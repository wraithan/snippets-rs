I'm going to try to keep track of my experiements. I commonly use a REPL to test
stuff in other languages but I can't do that in rust. Giving myself a rust
playground project means I can both try out things, and save them for later.
Putting them on github means I can easily share for conversations on IRC,
Twitter or at meetups.

I'll try to make a project dir for each type of experiment so I can document the
more useful ones.
